From 354625c
  - the color schemes are loaded from the `cmus_theme_dir` now
  - the `cmus_theme_dir` is cmus_config_dir + "/themes"
  - `cmus_playlist_dir` is always cmus_config_dir + "/playlists"
  - idk what playlist moving was about but it's gone now
  - the configuration file is in the config dir now. The whole rc
  - so, no need to load optional static config
